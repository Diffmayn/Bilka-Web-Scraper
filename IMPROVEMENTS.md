# 🚀 Bilka Price Monitor - Code Review & Improvements

## Executive Summary

I've completed a comprehensive review and enhancement of your Bilka.dk price monitoring tool. The **core source code modules were missing** from the `src/` directory, so I've created them from scratch with **advanced features specifically designed to identify unnaturally good deals**.

---

## 🔍 What Was Missing

Your project had excellent documentation and structure, but the actual implementation was missing:

### Missing Modules (Now Created):
- ✅ `src/scraper/` - Web scraping engine
- ✅ `src/data/` - Database and data processing
- ✅ `src/analysis/` - **Advanced analysis algorithms**
- ✅ `src/ui/` - Dashboard interface

---

## 🎯 Key Improvements for Detecting Unnaturally Good Deals

### 1. **Advanced Discount Analyzer** (`src/analysis/discount_analyzer.py`)

This is the core module for identifying unnaturally good offers. It includes:

#### **Statistical Outlier Detection**
- **Z-score analysis**: Identifies discounts that are 2.5+ standard deviations above the mean
- **Category benchmarking**: Compares deals within their product category
- **Deal Quality Scoring**: 0-100 score based on multiple factors

#### **Suspicious Deal Detection**
The `_detect_suspicious_deals()` method uses multiple checks:

```python
# Check 1: Statistical outlier
if discount is 2.5σ above category average → +30 points

# Check 2: Extreme discount
if discount >= 90% → +40 points
if discount >= 80% → +30 points
if discount >= 70% → +20 points

# Check 3: Price too low for category
if current_price < 20% of category median → +25 points

# Check 4: Suspiciously round original price
if original_price is round number (100, 150, 200) → +10 points

# Check 5: Inflated original price
if original_price > 1.5x category 90th percentile → +20 points

# Check 6: Exceptional deal quality
if deal_quality_score > 85/100 → +15 points
```

**Suspicion score >= 40 = Flagged as suspicious**

#### **Deal Quality Score**
Calculates how "good" a deal is:
- Discount percentage (0-40 points)
- Absolute savings (0-30 points)
- Relative to category average (0-30 points)

### 2. **Anomaly Detector** (`src/analysis/anomaly_detector.py`)

Five different detection methods:

#### **Method 1: Z-Score Outliers**
- Detects statistical outliers in discount distribution
- Confidence score based on standard deviations from mean

#### **Method 2: IQR (Interquartile Range)**
- Uses robust statistics to find outliers
- Less sensitive to extreme values than Z-score

#### **Method 3: Fake Discount Detection** ⭐
**This is crucial for identifying deceptive pricing!**

```python
Indicators of fake discounts:
1. Original price is suspiciously round (500, 1000, 1500 DKK)
2. Discount percentage is also round (50%, 75%)
3. Original price is 2.5x+ category median
4. Large discount but final price is average for category
5. Pattern detection (price * 2 = original price)
```

**Real-world example:**
- Product shows "50% OFF - Was 2000 DKK, Now 1000 DKK"
- But category median is 950 DKK
- **Likely fake discount!** The "original" price was never real.

#### **Method 4: Too-Good-To-Be-True Detection** ⭐
**Your primary use case!**

```python
Factors that trigger TGTBT flag:
- Discount >= 95% → High suspicion
- Discount >= 90% → Medium suspicion
- Savings > 5000 DKK → Massive savings flag
- Premium brand (Apple, Samsung) at bargain price
- Current price < 50 DKK but original > 500 DKK
```

**Confidence scoring:**
- 0.9-1.0: Almost certainly an error or scam
- 0.8-0.9: Very suspicious, investigate thoroughly
- 0.7-0.8: Likely too good to be true
- 0.6-0.7: Unusually good, verify before buying

#### **Method 5: Price Manipulation**
Detects suspicious pricing patterns:
- Original ends in .99, sale ends in .00
- Discount is exactly 50%, 75%, 66.7%, 33.3%
- Current price * 2 = original price (artificially doubled)

### 3. **Price Validator** (`src/analysis/price_validator.py`)

Validates pricing data for errors:
- Negative prices
- Price inversions (sale > original)
- Extreme discounts (>95%)
- Discount calculation mismatches
- Out-of-range prices

### 4. **Historical Price Tracking**

New `PriceHistory` model tracks:
- All price changes over time
- Discount history
- Trend analysis capabilities

This enables:
- **Fake discount detection**: Compare "original price" to historical prices
- **Price drop alerts**: Identify genuine price drops
- **Seasonal pattern analysis**: Understand normal discount cycles

### 5. **Enhanced Database Schema**

New tables:
```sql
products - Main product data
price_history - Historical price tracking
scrape_logs - Activity logging
anomaly_detections - Flagged suspicious deals
```

### 6. **Improved Web Scraper**

Features:
- **Anti-detection measures**: Stealth mode, random delays, rotating user agents
- **Dynamic scrolling**: Loads more products automatically
- **Robust error handling**: Retries and graceful failures
- **Session management**: Proper WebDriver lifecycle

---

## 📊 How to Use the New Features

### 1. Run the Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run src/ui/dashboard.py
```

The dashboard now has **4 tabs**:

#### **🔥 Suspicious Deals Tab**
Shows products flagged as unnaturally good:
- Suspicion score (0-100)
- Reasons for flagging
- Deal quality score
- Personalized recommendations

#### **📊 All Products Tab**
Browse all scraped products with:
- Filter option for high discounts (70%+)
- Sort by discount percentage
- Export to CSV

#### **📈 Analytics Tab**
Visual analytics:
- Discount distribution chart
- Category breakdown
- Average discount by category
- Price distribution histogram

#### **🚨 Anomalies Tab**
Detailed anomaly detection:
- Grouped by anomaly type
- Confidence scores
- Evidence for each detection
- Actionable recommendations

### 2. Identify Unnaturally Good Deals

The system automatically flags deals based on:

```python
# Example output in dashboard:
"Samsung Galaxy Phone - 92% OFF"
Suspicion Score: 85/100

Reasons:
- Extreme discount: 92%
- Discount is 4.2σ above category average
- Original price may be inflated (2999 vs category median 899)
- Suspiciously round original price: 2999.00

Recommendation: ⚠️ HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS - Verify carefully before purchasing
```

### 3. API Usage

```python
from src.analysis.discount_analyzer import analyze_product_discounts
from src.analysis.anomaly_detector import detect_suspicious_deals
import pandas as pd

# Analyze discounts
analysis = analyze_product_discounts(products_df)

# Get suspicious deals
suspicious = analysis.suspicious_deals
for deal in suspicious:
    if deal['suspicion_score'] > 70:
        print(f"ALERT: {deal['name']} - {deal['discount_percentage']}%")
        print(f"Reasons: {deal['reasons']}")

# Detect anomalies
anomalies = detect_suspicious_deals(products_df)
for anomaly in anomalies:
    if anomaly.confidence_score > 0.8:
        print(f"ANOMALY: {anomaly.product_name}")
        print(f"Type: {anomaly.anomaly_type}")
        print(f"Confidence: {anomaly.confidence_score:.1%}")
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

Update `config/settings.yaml`:

```yaml
analysis:
  high_discount_threshold: 75      # Flag discounts above this
  critical_discount_threshold: 90  # Critical alert threshold
  price_error_margin: 0.05         # 5% tolerance for calculations
  
  # New settings for anomaly detection
  z_score_threshold: 2.5           # Statistical outlier threshold
  iqr_multiplier: 1.5              # IQR outlier multiplier
  min_confidence: 0.6              # Minimum confidence for anomalies
  
  # Fake discount detection
  suspicious_round_prices: [50, 100, 150, 200, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000]
  original_price_inflation_factor: 2.5  # Flag if original > 2.5x category median
```

## 🎯 Best Practices for Finding Unnaturally Good Deals

### 1. **Set Up Automated Monitoring**

```python
# Run daily scraping
python main.py scrape --category all --max-products 200

# Analyze results
python main.py analyze --output daily_analysis.json
```

### 2. **Focus on High-Value Categories**

Electronics tend to have the most suspicious deals:
```python
# Focus on electronics
python main.py scrape --category electronics --max-products 500
```

### 3. **Monitor Suspicion Score Trends**

- **40-60**: Worth investigating
- **60-80**: Suspicious, verify carefully
- **80-100**: Almost certainly an error or scam

### 4. **Cross-Reference with Historical Data**

The system tracks price history. Use this to:
- Verify if "original price" was ever actually charged
- Identify genuine price drops vs. fake discounts
- Understand seasonal patterns

### 5. **Check Anomaly Types**

Different anomaly types indicate different issues:
- **TOO_GOOD_TO_BE_TRUE**: Potential genuine error or clearance
- **FAKE_DISCOUNT**: Deceptive marketing practice
- **PRICE_MANIPULATION**: Systematic pricing games
- **STATISTICAL_OUTLIER**: Unusual but may be legitimate

## 🚨 Known Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations:

1. **No Competitor Price Comparison**
   - Currently only analyzes within Bilka.dk
   - **Future**: Scrape competitors (Føtex, Billigvarer, etc.)

2. **No Historical Market Price Database**
   - Can't compare to long-term market averages
   - **Future**: Build price history database over months

3. **No Product Condition Detection**
   - Can't distinguish new vs. refurbished vs. damaged
   - **Future**: Parse product condition from description

4. **Limited Brand Intelligence**
   - Doesn't know typical price ranges for specific brands/models
   - **Future**: Build brand/model price database

5. **No Review/Seller Reputation Analysis**
   - Can't factor in seller trustworthiness
   - **Future**: Integrate review data

### Suggested Future Enhancements:

#### 1. **Machine Learning Model**
```python
# Train ML model on labeled data
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Features: discount%, price, category, brand, etc.
# Label: legitimate_deal (True/False)
model = train_deal_classifier(historical_data)
```

#### 2. **Alert System**
```python
# Email/SMS alerts for exceptional deals
if suspicion_score >= 80:
    send_alert(product, user_email)
```

#### 3. **Competitor Price Comparison**
```python
# Scrape multiple retailers
bilka_price = scrape_bilka(product)
foetex_price = scrape_foetex(product)
pricerunner_price = get_pricerunner(product)

if bilka_price < min(foetex_price, pricerunner_price) * 0.5:
    flag_as_suspicious()
```

#### 4. **Image Analysis**
```python
# Detect stock photos vs. actual product photos
# Flag products with generic/stock images
```

---

## 📚 Code Quality Improvements

### 1. **Error Handling**
All modules now have comprehensive error handling:
```python
try:
    products = scraper.scrape_category(category)
except TimeoutException:
    logger.warning("Scraping timeout, retrying...")
except WebDriverException:
    logger.error("WebDriver error, switching to mock mode")
```

### 2. **Logging**
Structured logging throughout:
```python
logger.info(f"Scraped {len(products)} products")
logger.warning(f"Invalid product data: {product_name}")
logger.error(f"Database error: {str(e)}")
```

### 3. **Type Hints**
Modern Python type hints for better IDE support:
```python
def analyze(self, products_df: pd.DataFrame) -> DiscountAnalysis:
    ...
```

### 4. **Documentation**
Comprehensive docstrings:
```python
def detect_fake_discounts(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> List[AnomalyResult]:
    """
    Detect fake discounts where original price may be artificially inflated
    
    This is crucial for identifying deceptive pricing practices
    
    Args:
        df: DataFrame with product data
        
    Returns:
        List of AnomalyResult objects
    """
```

### 5. **Configuration Management**
Centralized configuration via YAML files
Overridable via environment variables

## 🎓 Understanding the Algorithms

### How Fake Discount Detection Works:

#### Example 1: Genuine Deal
```
Product: "Samsung TV"
Original Price: 899 DKK (matches historical average)
Current Price: 649 DKK
Discount: 28%
Category Median: 850 DKK

Analysis: ✅ LEGITIMATE
- Discount is reasonable
- Original price aligns with market
- Final price below but close to median
```

#### Example 2: Fake Discount
```
Product: "Generic TV"
Original Price: 2999 DKK (🚩 suspiciously round, 3x category median)
Current Price: 999 DKK (exactly 1/3, 🚩 pattern detected)
Discount: 67% (🚩 suspiciously round)
Category Median: 950 DKK (🚩 final price is average!)

Analysis: ⚠️ FAKE DISCOUNT
- Original price never actually charged
- Final price is market average
- Discount creates false urgency
```

### How Statistical Outlier Detection Works:

```python
# Calculate statistics
mean_discount = 25%
std_deviation = 10%

# Product has 85% discount
z_score = (85 - 25) / 10 = 6.0

# Interpretation:
# z_score > 2.5 = Outlier
# z_score > 3.0 = Extreme outlier
# z_score > 5.0 = Almost certainly error

# 6.0 is 6 standard deviations above mean
# Probability of genuine: < 0.001%
# Verdict: SUSPICIOUS
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Initialize Database
```bash
python main.py init
```

### 3. Scrape Products (Test Mode)
```bash
# Uses mock scraper (no actual web scraping)
set USE_MOCK_SCRAPER=true
python main.py scrape --category electronics --max-products 100
```

### 4. Run Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run src/ui/dashboard.py
```

### 5. For Real Scraping
```bash
# Download ChromeDriver first
# Update config/settings.yaml: headless: false (for debugging)
set USE_MOCK_SCRAPER=false
python main.py scrape --category electronics --max-products 50
```

---

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

1. **Start with Mock Data**: Test the system with mock scraper first
2. **Monitor Gradually**: Start with 50-100 products per category
3. **Review Flagged Items**: Manually verify high-suspicion items
4. **Adjust Thresholds**: Tune confidence thresholds based on results
5. **Build History**: Let system run for weeks to build price history
6. **Focus on Categories**: Electronics/tech have most suspicious deals
7. **Check Timing**: Scrapers work best during off-peak hours
8. **Respect Robots.txt**: Add appropriate delays between requests
