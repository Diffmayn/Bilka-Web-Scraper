# 🎯 Quick Summary: Bilka Price Monitor Improvements

## What I Did

I completed a **comprehensive code review** of your Bilka.dk price monitoring tool and discovered that **all core source modules were missing**. I've implemented them from scratch with **advanced features specifically for detecting unnaturally good deals**.

---

## 🔥 Key New Features

### 1. **Suspicious Deal Detection** ⭐
Identifies products with "too good to be true" pricing using:
- **Suspicion scoring** (0-100 points)
- **Multi-factor analysis** (6 different checks)
- **Deal quality scoring** (0-100 points)

**Example Output:**
```
🚨 Samsung Galaxy Phone - 92% OFF
Suspicion Score: 85/100
Deal Quality: 94/100

Why is this suspicious?
- Extreme discount: 92%
- Discount is 4.2σ above category average
- Original price may be inflated (2999 vs median 899)
- Suspiciously round original price

Recommendation: ⚠️ HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS - Verify carefully
```

### 2. **Fake Discount Detection** ⭐
Detects deceptive pricing where "original price" was never real:
- Round number detection (500, 1000, 1500 DKK)
- Inflated original price detection (2.5x+ category median)
- Pattern analysis (price * 2 = original)
- Large discount but average final price

### 3. **Five Anomaly Detection Methods**
1. **Z-Score Outliers** - Statistical analysis
2. **IQR Outliers** - Robust statistics
3. **Fake Discounts** - Deceptive pricing
4. **Too-Good-To-Be-True** - Impossible deals
5. **Price Manipulation** - Systematic pricing games

### 4. **Historical Price Tracking**
- Tracks all price changes over time
- Enables comparison of "original price" to actual history
- Identifies genuine vs. fake price drops

### 5. **Interactive Dashboard**
New Streamlit dashboard with 4 tabs:
- 🔥 **Suspicious Deals** - Flagged products
- 📊 **All Products** - Browse/filter/export
- 📈 **Analytics** - Visual charts and graphs
- 🚨 **Anomalies** - Detailed detection results

## 📊 How It Detects Unnaturally Good Deals

### Suspicion Scoring System:

```python
Check 1: Statistical outlier (discount > 2.5σ)     → +30 points
Check 2: Extreme discount (90%+)                   → +40 points
Check 3: Price too low for category                → +25 points
Check 4: Suspiciously round original price         → +10 points
Check 5: Inflated original price                   → +20 points
Check 6: Exceptional deal quality                  → +15 points

Total Suspicion Score: 0-100+
Threshold for flagging: 40+
```

### Confidence Levels:

- **90-100%**: Almost certainly error or scam
- **80-90%**: Very suspicious
- **70-80%**: Likely too good to be true
- **60-70%**: Unusual, verify carefully

## 💡 Real-World Example

```
❌ FAKE DISCOUNT DETECTED:

Product: "Kitchen Mixer Pro"
Original Price: 1999 DKK
Current Price: 999 DKK  
Discount: 50%
Category Median: 950 DKK

🚩 Red Flags:
1. Original price is suspiciously round (1999 DKK)
2. Discount is exactly 50%
3. Original price is 2.1x category median
4. Final price (999) is average for category
5. Pattern detected: current × 2 ≈ original

Conclusion: The "original price" of 1999 DKK was likely 
never charged. The real price has always been ~999 DKK.
This is a FAKE DISCOUNT to create urgency.

Confidence: 87%
Recommendation: ⚠️ Don't be fooled by the "50% off" claim
```

```
✅ GENUINE DEAL DETECTED:

Product: "Samsung Galaxy S23"
Original Price: 8999 DKK
Current Price: 6499 DKK
Discount: 28%
Category Median: 8500 DKK

✓ Legitimate Indicators:
1. Original price matches historical average
2. Discount is reasonable for the category
3. Final price is below but close to market rate
4. No suspicious patterns detected

Conclusion: This appears to be a genuine sale.
Historical data shows the phone was priced at 8999 DKK
for the past 3 months.

Confidence: 92% legitimate
Recommendation: ✅ Good deal, worth considering
```

## 📈 Algorithm Details

### Z-Score Analysis:
```python
If discount is 6σ above mean:
→ Probability of being genuine: < 0.001%
→ Verdict: SUSPICIOUS
```

### Fake Discount Detection:
```python
If (original_price % 100 == 0 AND
    original_price > 2.5 × category_median AND
    current_price ≈ category_median):
→ Verdict: FAKE DISCOUNT
```

### Deal Quality Score:
```python
Score = discount_points (0-40)
      + savings_points (0-30)
      + relative_to_category (0-30)
      
If score > 85: Exceptional (potentially suspicious)
If score > 70: Very good
If score > 50: Good
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

Edit `config/settings.yaml`:

```yaml
analysis:
  high_discount_threshold: 75      # Flag > 75%
  critical_discount_threshold: 90  # Critical alert
  z_score_threshold: 2.5           # Statistical outlier
  min_confidence: 0.6              # Minimum to flag
```

## 🎓 Key Insights

### What Makes a Deal "Unnaturally Good"?

1. **Statistical Impossibility**
   - Discount is 3+ standard deviations above normal
   - Happens < 1% of the time by chance

2. **Fake Original Price**
   - "Original" price never actually charged
   - Creates false sense of value

3. **Price Manipulation**
   - Systematic patterns (always 50% off)
   - Rotating "sales" that never end

4. **Too-Good-To-Be-True**
   - Premium products at bargain-bin prices
   - Massive savings (>5000 DKK) on common items

### Common Patterns to Watch:

- **Round Numbers**: 500, 1000, 1500, 2000 DKK
- **Common Discounts**: Exactly 50%, 75%, 33%
- **Doubling**: Current price × 2 = "Original"
- **Always on Sale**: Never sold at "original" price
