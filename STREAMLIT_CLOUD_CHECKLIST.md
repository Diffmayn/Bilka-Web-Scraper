## üåê Streamlit Cloud Deployment

### Current Deployment
Your app: **https://bilka-web-scraper-c5tlxwm3snr3utsxpj6yeb.streamlit.app/**

### What Happens Next

1. **Automatic Redeployment**
   - Streamlit Cloud detects GitHub push
   - Will automatically redeploy with new code
   - Takes ~3-5 minutes

2. **System Package Installation**
   - Streamlit Cloud reads `packages.txt`
   - Installs: `chromium` and `chromium-driver`
   - Enables real web scraping on Linux

3. **First Run**
   - Database initializes automatically (empty at first)
   - Click "Start Scraping" button in sidebar
   - Real scraper will attempt to scrape Bilka.dk
   - Results stored in SQLite database

---

## üß™ Testing After Deployment

### Step 1: Wait for Redeployment
- Check Streamlit Cloud dashboard
- Wait for "Running" status (green)

### Step 2: Open Your App
Visit: https://bilka-web-scraper-c5tlxwm3snr3utsxpj6yeb.streamlit.app/

### Step 3: Verify Real Scraping
1. **Check UI**: Should NOT show "Demo Mode" or "Sample Data"
2. **Click "Start Scraping"** in sidebar
3. **Select a category** (e.g., "electronics")
4. **Set max products** (start with 10 for testing)
5. **Click "Start Scraping" button**

### Expected Behavior

#### ‚úÖ Success Scenario
```
‚úÖ Chromium installed successfully
‚úÖ ChromeDriver initialized
‚úÖ Navigating to Bilka.dk...
‚úÖ Scraping products...
‚úÖ Found 10 products
‚úÖ Data stored in database
```

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Fallback Scenario (if ChromeDriver fails)
```
‚ö†Ô∏è ChromeDriver not available
‚ö†Ô∏è Falling back to mock data
‚ÑπÔ∏è To enable real scraping, check logs
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still Showing Mock Data

**Possible Causes:**
1. Streamlit Cloud hasn't redeployed yet (wait 5 minutes)
2. Environment variable `USE_MOCK_SCRAPER` is set to `true`
3. ChromeDriver setup failed

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Streamlit Cloud logs:**
   - Go to Streamlit Cloud dashboard
   - Click on your app
   - View "Manage app" ‚Üí "Logs"
   - Look for ChromeDriver errors

2. **Verify environment variables:**
   - In Streamlit Cloud settings
   - Make sure `USE_MOCK_SCRAPER` is NOT set (or set to `false`)

3. **Check packages.txt:**
   - Verify file exists in repository root
   - Should contain: `chromium` and `chromium-driver`

### Issue: ChromeDriver Errors

**Common Error Messages:**

```
WebDriverException: Message: unknown error: Chrome failed to start
```

**Solution:**
- This is expected on Streamlit Cloud free tier sometimes
- The app will automatically fall back to mock data
- Real scraping works best on local machine or paid cloud services

### Issue: No Products Found

**Possible Causes:**
1. Bilka.dk changed their HTML structure
2. CSS selectors are outdated
3. Being rate-limited by Bilka.dk
4. Network issues

**Solutions:**
1. Check `config/scraping_rules.yaml` selectors
2. Increase delays in `config/settings.yaml`
3. Try scraping fewer products
4. Test locally first

---

## üîß Configuration Options

### Environment Variables (Streamlit Cloud)

To set environment variables in Streamlit Cloud:
1. Go to app settings
2. Click "Advanced settings"
3. Add environment variables

**Useful Variables:**

```bash
# Force mock mode (for testing)
USE_MOCK_SCRAPER=true

# Increase scraping timeout
SCRAPING_TIMEOUT=60

# Set specific Chrome binary path (if needed)
CHROME_BINARY_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium
```

### Scraping Configuration

Edit files in `config/` folder:

**`config/settings.yaml`:**
```yaml
scraping:
  headless: true          # Must be true on Streamlit Cloud
  request_delay_min: 2    # Seconds between requests
  request_delay_max: 5
  max_retries: 3
  timeout: 30
```

**`config/scraping_rules.yaml`:**
```yaml
selectors:
  # CSS selectors for Bilka.dk
  product_container: ".product-card"
  product_name: ".v-card__title"
  # ... etc
```

---

## üìä Monitoring

### Check Logs

**Streamlit Cloud Logs:**
1. Go to app dashboard
2. Click "Manage app"
3. View real-time logs

**Look For:**
```
‚úÖ Good Signs:
- "ChromeDriver initialized successfully"
- "Navigating to Bilka.dk"
- "Found X products"
- "Stored products in database"

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning Signs:
- "ChromeDriver not found"
- "Falling back to mock data"
- "WebDriverException"
- "Timeout waiting for element"
```

### Database Status

The app will show database statistics in the sidebar:
- Total products in database
- Last scraping time
- Number of suspicious deals

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful if:

- [x] ‚úÖ App loads without errors
- [x] ‚úÖ No "Demo Mode" messaging visible
- [x] ‚úÖ "Start Scraping" button works
- [x] ‚úÖ Real data appears (not mock/sample data)
- [x] ‚úÖ Suspicious deals are detected
- [x] ‚úÖ Charts and analytics display correctly
- [x] ‚úÖ Database persists between page refreshes

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### If Real Scraping Works ‚úÖ
1. **Increase product count**: Scrape 50-100 products
2. **Try multiple categories**: electronics, food, household
3. **Set up scheduling**: Run daily scraping
4. **Monitor performance**: Check for suspicious deals
5. **Export data**: Use export features to analyze trends

### If Real Scraping Doesn't Work ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **Don't panic!** Mock data still works for demonstration
2. **Check logs** for specific errors
3. **Test locally** to verify selectors
4. **Consider alternatives**:
   - Run locally and export data manually
   - Use scheduled local runs with cron/Task Scheduler
   - Deploy to VPS with full Chrome support

### Recommended: Test Locally First
```bash
# On your local machine (Windows)
cd "c:\Users\248075\.vscode\cli\WEb SCraper\bilka_price_monitor"
python main.py scrape --category electronics --max-products 10
```

This verifies:
- ChromeDriver works
- Selectors are correct
- Bilka.dk is accessible
- Data processing works
