## 🎭 Demo Mode vs Real Scraping

### On Streamlit Cloud (Current Setup):
- ✅ Uses **mock data generator** (no real web scraping)
- ✅ Creates realistic product data with various discounts
- ✅ Includes intentional "suspicious" deals for testing
- ✅ Works perfectly without ChromeDriver
- ✅ Demonstrates all anomaly detection features

### For Real Scraping (Local Setup):
If you want to scrape real Bilka.dk data, run locally:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Diffmayn/Bilka-Web-Scraper.git
cd Bilka-Web-Scraper

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install ChromeDriver
# Download from: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/

# Set to use real scraper
set USE_MOCK_SCRAPER=false

# Run locally
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

---

## 📊 What the Mock Data Includes

The mock scraper generates realistic data:

- **Product names** from actual categories
- **Price ranges** appropriate for each category
- **60% of products** have discounts (realistic ratio)
- **5% have extreme discounts** (90%+) for testing anomaly detection
- **Various brands** (Samsung, Sony, LG, Apple, etc.)
- **Different availability** statuses

---

## 🔄 Streamlit Cloud Auto-Deployment

Your app will automatically redeploy when:
- You push changes to GitHub
- Streamlit detects changes in your repository

**Redeployment time:** Usually 1-2 minutes

**To force a restart:**
1. Go to: https://share.streamlit.io/
2. Find your app: "bilka-web-scraper"
3. Click "Manage app"
4. Click "Reboot app"

---

## 🗄️ Database Persistence

**Important:** Streamlit Cloud uses **ephemeral storage**:
- ✅ Database persists during active session
- ❌ Database is **cleared on app restart** or redeployment
- ℹ️ This is normal for demo/free tier

**What this means:**
- Generated sample data stays as long as app is running
- After restart, you need to regenerate sample data
- Perfect for demos and testing

**For persistent storage**, you would need:
- External database (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)
- Streamlit Cloud paid tier with persistent storage

---

## 🎨 Customization Options

You can customize the app by editing these files:

### Change Detection Thresholds:
**File:** `config/settings.yaml`
```yaml
analysis:
  high_discount_threshold: 75      # Adjust this
  critical_discount_threshold: 90  # And this
  z_score_threshold: 2.5
  min_confidence: 0.6
```

### Modify UI:
**File:** `src/ui/dashboard.py`
- Change colors, layout, text
- Add new tabs or sections
- Customize charts and graphs

### Adjust Mock Data:
**File:** `src/scraper/mock_scraper.py`
- Change product names
- Adjust price ranges
- Modify discount distribution

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### App Still Shows Error:
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for automatic redeployment
2. Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5)
3. Check deployment status at share.streamlit.io

### Data Not Generating:
1. Click "Generate Sample Data" button
2. Wait for spinner to complete
3. Refresh the page if needed

### Slow Performance:
- Streamlit Cloud free tier has limited resources
- Reduce number of products (try 50 instead of 200)
- Clear browser cache
